## AI Content Blocklist(s)
The goal of this project is to create a blocklist (or possibly multiple blocklists) to block AI generated content.

My focus is specifically on websites with AI generated news, answers, etc. I will not be blocking any discussion of AI, AI generated image or video, or any demonstrations of AI generated content that is clearly labeled as such.

## Contributing
Please submit a pull request or issue if you would like to add any websites to this list. If you think a website was incorrectly added, please create an issue.
